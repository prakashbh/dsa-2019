Every programmer must have an owned library of codes. They come in handy at need. Here is mine: [Day-Today Codes](https://github.com/prakashbh/day-today-codes). If you create and have a library of your own, well, you should!

### Prerequisites
* A quick revision of [C Basic](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-c-basics.pdf) concepts.
* You can revise your knowledge of structures through this ebook: [Structures and C](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/644937). The book covers structures from the very basics to complex programs. 
* Basic theory notes of [Stacks, Queues and Lists](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-stacks-queues-lists-theory.pdf)
* [Applications](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-stacks-queues-lists-continued.pdf) of basic data structures
* [Implementation](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/course-notes/0-stacks-queues-lists-implementation.pdf) of basic data structures

## Challenges

**Challenge 01: Essay**

One of the essential skill for a problem solver is Comprehension capability. Hence, the first challenge is an essay challenge. Read the ebook: [Design of a Programmer](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/639609) and write an essay of 300-500 words. Your essay must not be a book review. It must be your take away thoughts. Pen down your thoughts on an A4 sheet with your name and roll number and submit it by the end of the class on **17th Aug 2019, 10.00am**. 

This is a compulsory challenge. All essays will be reviewed and graded on a scale of 1 to 35.

The Challenge scorecard can be accessed here: [DOP Scorecard](https://tinyurl.com/dop-3c-2019)

**Challenge 02: Code The Philosophy**

You are given with a list of ten philosophies. You need to code a simple C program to realize it. More details in the pdf: [Code The Philosophy Challenge](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/2-code-the-philosophy.pdf). Deadline is **25th August 2019, 5.00pm, Sunday**. Adhere to submission guidelines as mentioned. Use the template given to code. Fill up all the TO-DO sections. Template can be found [Here](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/2-code-the-philosophy-template.c).

This is a compulsory challenge. The top submission will receive a DSA PUDDINGA trophy.



**Challenge 03: MAT Challenge**

Look out for the [MAT Challenge](https://github.com/prakashbh/dsa-2019/blob/master/challenges/3-MAT-challenge.pdf). Along with students, even the course instructor will be taking up this challenge. Any student who designs and codes a better solution than course instructor scores a 100/100. More details in the supplied pdf. The submission deadline is **1 September 2019, 9.00pm**. 



**Challenge 04: TBD**
